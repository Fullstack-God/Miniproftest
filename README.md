# MiniPerfTest
Testing MiniProfiler


Run the project and then go to

/profiler/results

you will see some results for the initial page load.

Then navigate to

/api/Users

You should see an Empty JSON array but then go back to:

/profiler/results

and you should see some more info about the request, and the timing involved.

We can setup a storage option to log all of the data returned from MiniProfiler to either a JSON file or a SQL Database.
